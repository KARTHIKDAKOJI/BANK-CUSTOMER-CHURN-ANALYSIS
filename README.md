Action: Improve onboarding and engagement in year one.

✅ Q5. High-Risk Customers
Inactive members with low satisfaction and complaints are at risk.

✅ Q6. Age Group Churn
Highest churn in the 46–60 age group.
Action: Offer more personalized services to older customers.

 ✅ Q7. Credit Score vs. Churn

✅ Q8. Credit Card Ownership
Customers with credit cards churn more.
Action: Rework credit card offers and reduce extra charges.

✅ Q9. Gender & Region Churn
Female customers show higher churn in most regions.
Action: Study needs/preferences and improve communication and services for female customers.
